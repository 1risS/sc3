libsc
-----

This project is a translation of the core features of sclang to Python 3. The repository is private and comments and commits are in Spanish for now, it will be public and internationalized if I get to succed to some extent on this task.

The main reason for this is Python's capacity of interaction with other libraries and frameworks applicable to composition, sonic-art and digital life in general.
